 "description": "VEKTOR is the project token of the Vektor crypto mentoring group. 
This is an essential part of the range of services and also serves 
to visualize the individual project packages. We make our possibilities 
and experience available as a real product and interweave it directly with 
our portfolio, thereby enabling all investors and holders to participate 
in the overall success of the project. 

The fusion through implementation, application and benefit is a basic economic factor 
for project success. Especially through the application of the mentoring process, 
we can positively influence the course of projects and thus ensure an impact in the 
development process. Our mission is to establish more value-added projects and thus 
generate a sustainable impact on the development of blockchain adoption.
